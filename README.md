# **_Hi there, I'm Ibrahim_** ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionte about **_Engineering_**, **_Math and Science_**, **_Technology_**, and **_Continuous Learning_** I love working on innovative projects that combine **_hardware and software_**, especially in areas like **_embedded systems_**, **_FPGA design_**, and **_AI acceleration_**.


## ðŸš€ **_About Me_**
- My goal is to become highly proficient in **_math, digital design, and AI hardware acceleration_**.
- Exploring FPGA-based AI accelerators**, specifically for **_digital signal classification and natural language processing (NLP)_**. I'm fascinated by how AI models can be optimized to run efficiently on hardware.
- Learning more about **embedded systems and hardware-software co-design**.
- Developing my understanding of **AI, digital design, and optimization techniques** to bridge the gap between theory and real applications.
- Always curious and always learning â€” if you're working on something similar or just want to chat about these topics, feel free to reach out!






## ðŸ›  **_Engineering Toolkit_**
- **Languages**: C, C++, Python, VHDL, Verilog
- **Embedded/Hardware**: Arduino, FPGA (Xilinx Zynq-7000)
- **Software/Tools**: LabVIEW, TestStand, Vivado, VS Code
